![LarryShell](logo.png "LarryShell")

LarryShell is a variation of `bash` which makes it behave more like Larry.

## What does LarryShell do?

LarryShell modifies `bash` to create a more affluent command-line interface, complete with a response telling you whether or not you are rich or poor depending on whether or not the previous command you ran was successful.  LarryShell also sasses you and calls you bad if your command does not run successfully.

## Running LarryShell

To run LarryShell, simply execute `chmod +x larryshell` to make the file executable, then run `./larryshell`.
